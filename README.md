# Description

The purpose of this project is to create a language model that can use a encoder/decoder architecture.
The encoding/decoding should be able to

## Architectures

The architectures are based on 'vanilla', 'gers' and 'peephole'.
The architectures share weights and memory gates use bias units.

Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.

### Future Plans consist of the following
Horizontal rule:

Plans:

  * Implement a BiLSTM encoder/decoder
  * Be able to train a CNN representation
  * Implement GD tehniques from scratch
